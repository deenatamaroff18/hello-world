# hello-world
A practice repository as part of Hello World tutorial. 
I'm Deena. I'm just learning coding and I'm not confused yet.
But I'm sure that will change. 
This is a different commit than the one that I made to the master branch. That's because I wasn't supopsed to make that commit, so now I'm making it here and am making sure that the readme-edits branch and the master branch are different, as they're supposed to be.
